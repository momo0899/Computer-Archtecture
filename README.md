#Hw3
-The first 7 lines import the libraries that were used like "fstream" for reading files,"vector" for creating arrays and so.
-The code in the main function allows the user to input two arguments which are the number of entries and associativity.
-The file with name "input0" will be read and taken the data from it. Which means is in accurate because the input file name maybe different.
-an array is created with the number of entries and then the input file get read and go through each postion of the array with an incrementing variables called "index" and "place". IF the number is in the array the output will be "HIT". IF it is not in the array it will output "MISS" and that input number will take the current "place" will be incremented while index will be incremented till the input file has no more inputs and afterwords it will close
- The code will work on certain test cases which the associativity doesn't matter, Some other cases will not get all the output cases correct.
- The code will not work on zeus but in any other online C++ server it should compile perfectly fine.
